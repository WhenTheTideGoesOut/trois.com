Brexit Busting Bumper Business  App

The idea behind this app is to take businesses from the EU that have been adversely affected by Brexit and have relied upon either buyers or suppliers from the UK and connect them with buyers or suppliers within the EU.

It would be great to add ordering capabilities.
And Also take this beyond Brexit. Provide import/export advice etc. 

Also, This would be great to get to learn as part of this, as I am trying to learn as part of this.
